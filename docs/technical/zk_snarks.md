### **Overview**  
This document details the implementation of zk-SNARKs (Zero-Knowledge Succinct Non-Interactive Arguments of Knowledge) within the system. zk-SNARKs provide privacy and security by allowing DAO members to prove the validity of their actions (e.g., voting) without revealing any sensitive information.  

---

### **Key Use Cases for zk-SNARKs**  

1. **Anonymous Voting:**  
   - DAO members submit votes using zk-SNARKs to maintain anonymity while ensuring vote validity.  

2. **Proof of Identity Ownership:**  
   - zk-SNARKs verify that a user owns a DID or SBT without revealing its content.  

---

### **Workflow for zk-SNARKs Integration**

#### **1. Circuit Design**  
Circuits define the rules for validating zero-knowledge proofs.  
- **Inputs:**
  - Private inputs (e.g., userâ€™s secret key hash).  
  - Public inputs (e.g., proposal ID, vote choice).  

- **Outputs:**
  - Boolean result indicating proof validity.  

- **Example Circuit for Voting:**
  - Check if the user is eligible to vote (SBT ownership).  
  - Verify that the vote choice is within the allowed range.  
  - Ensure each user can vote only once per proposal.  

#### **2. Proof Generation**  
Zero-knowledge proofs are generated off-chain using a trusted setup.  
- Tools:  
  - [Circom](https://docs.circom.io/) for circuit compilation.  
  - [Snarkjs](https://github.com/iden3/snarkjs) for proof generation.  

#### **3. Proof Verification**  
- Smart contracts verify zk-SNARK proofs on-chain.  
- Verification ensures that all conditions are met without revealing private data.

### **Steps to Implement zk-SNARKs**

#### **1. Define Circuits**  
- Use Circom to define circuits for voting and DID verification.  
- Example Voting Circuit Logic:
  ```plaintext
  function main(private userKeyHash, public proposalId, public voteChoice) {
      // Verify user eligibility
      assert(hash(userKeyHash) == storedHash);
      // Validate voteChoice
      assert(voteChoice >= 1 && voteChoice <= 3);
  }
  ```

#### **2. Perform Trusted Setup**  
- Generate setup parameters to enable zk-SNARKs.  
  - Example Commands:  
    ```bash
    snarkjs setup
    snarkjs compile voting.circom
    ```

#### **3. Generate Proofs**  
- Users create zk-SNARK proofs before interacting with the smart contract.  
  - Example Commands:  
    ```bash
    snarkjs generate_proof input.json circuit.wasm
    ```

#### **4. Smart Contract Integration**  
- Deploy a verifier contract to validate proofs.  
- Example Pseudocode for Proof Verification:
  ```solidity
  function verifyVote(bytes memory proof, uint[] memory publicInputs) public returns (bool) {
      return snarkjsVerifier(proof, publicInputs);
  }
  ```

#### **5. Test Proofs**  
- Test proof generation and verification with mock data to ensure correctness.

### **Tools and Libraries**  
1. **Circom:** A domain-specific language for defining circuits.  
2. **Snarkjs:** A toolkit for compiling circuits, generating proofs, and verifying them.  
3. **Groth16:** zk-SNARK proving scheme used for verification.  

---

### **Advantages of zk-SNARKs in This System**  
1. **Privacy:** User votes and identities remain private while proving validity.  
2. **Scalability:** zk-SNARKs are computationally efficient and suitable for large-scale systems.  
3. **Security:** Proofs cannot be forged, ensuring data integrity.

### **DiGraph Representation**  

Below is the Graphviz **DiGraph** code illustrating the zk-SNARK implementation workflow:  

```plaintext
digraph zkSNARKs_Workflow {
    rankdir=LR;
    node [shape=box, fontname="Arial"];

    User [label="User Wallet\n(DAO Member)", shape=ellipse];
    CircuitDesign [label="1. Circuit Design\n(Circom)"];
    ProofGeneration [label="2. Proof Generation\n(snarkjs)"];
    ProofVerification [label="3. Proof Verification\n(Smart Contract)"];
    Blockchain [label="On-Chain Verification"];

    User -> CircuitDesign [label="Define Inputs & Outputs"];
    CircuitDesign -> ProofGeneration [label="Generate Trusted Setup"];
    ProofGeneration -> User [label="Generate Proof"];
    User -> ProofVerification [label="Submit Proof"];
